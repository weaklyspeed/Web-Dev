    <h1>Lean on</h1>
    <p>Do you recall, not long ago<br>
    We would walk on the sidewalk?<br>
    Innocent, remember?<br>
    All we did was care for each other<br>
    But the night was warm<br>
    We were bold and young<br>
    All around, the wind blows<br>
    We would only hold on to let go</p>
